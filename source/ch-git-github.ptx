        <p>
<term>Git</term> is a distributed version control system
that tracks changes in any set of computer files.
Git was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 
for development of the Linux kernel. 
Git is free and open-source software.
        </p>
        <p>
Two core concepts of Git are <term>commits</term> (illustrated
in <xref ref="fig-git-branches"/> by circles) and <term>branches</term>
(illustrated in <xref ref="fig-git-branches"/> by lines). A
commit represents the state of of your project at a particular
point in its history. Branches allow this history to not be
linear: you can branch off to experiment on a particular new
feature, then merge this <q>feature branch</q> back into
the <q>main branch</q> when it's complete. This is particularly
useful when multiple people collaborate
(<xref ref="ch-collaboration"/>)
on a Git-managed project.
        </p>
        <p>
A Git project is often called a <term>repository</term>,
or <term>repo</term> for short.

        <p>
Another key feature of Git is the ability to share
your project, along with its history, with other people.
This is generally accomplished by hosting your repository
on a service such as <term>GitHub</term>:
<url href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</url>.
(Other such services
include <url href="https://bitbucket.org">BitBucket.org</url>
and <url href="https://gitlab.com">GitLab.com</url>.)
        </p>
        <p>
We'll use GitHub not only to host our repositories, but also
because it provides all the tools needed to author content
using only a web browser: no need for multiple installations or
memorizing incantations like <c>git commit -m "foobar"</c> to
type into a command line prompt.

An example of a project using Git and GitHub is the
document you're reading right now!
This book is open-sourced and shared at
<url href="https://github.com/StevenClontz/github-for-mathematicians"/>,
and was created completely using the tools described here.
