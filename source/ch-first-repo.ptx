All the features of GitHub we'll be using are available
using a free GitHub account. Make your account by
visiting <url href="https://github.com/signup"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
Many mathematicians are also eligible for GitHub's educator
discount, which provides additional functionality and
computational resources normally only available to
<q>Pro</q> users. Visit
<url href="https://education.github.com/" />
while logged into your account to request it.
(You do not need to wait for approval before
continuing to the next section.)

Once logged in, a new repository can be created by
pressing the <kbd>+</kbd> button in the toolbar,
or visiting <url href="https://github.com/new"/>.
        </p>
        <p>
The repository will need a name, which can be something
like <c>my-first-repo</c> for this tutorial. (GitHub
will also suggest a cute random name like
<c>ubiquitous-space-tribble</c> if you have writer's block.)
        </p>
        <p>
Repositories can be <term>public</term> to everyone
on the internet or <term>private</term> to only people you
approved. I encourage you to work publicly,
to make it easier to collaborate with the open-source
community <ndash/> I can personally attest to
publishing many garbage repositories on GitHub
(along with my hopefully-useful ones), and no one
has called me out for it yet!
        </p>
        <p>
The last option we'll make sure to select is to
<q>Initialize this repository with:
Add a README file</q>. Then click <q>Create repository</q>.
        </p>

    <section xml:id="sec-editing-readme-md">
        <title>Editing README.md</title>
        <p>
While logged into GitHub.com, you have the ability to edit
individual files on your repositories. (If your repository
is public, others can see those files, but cannot edit them
unless you make them a collaborator,
see <xref ref="ch-collaboration"/>.)
        </p>
        <p>
An easy way to edit an individual file is just to click
the pencil icon such as the one that appears on your README.
This file is written in <term>Markdown</term>, a markup language
that takes plain text <c>like *this*</c> and renders it
<q>like <em>this</em></q>.
        </p>
        <p>
Try to edit your file to say something like <q>I'm learning how to
use GitHub!</q>, perhaps adding a link back to this document
using <c>[this markup](https://jmm2024.clontz.org)</c>. You
can click the Preview tab to see what your README will look like,
or visit <url href="https://www.MarkdownTutorial.com"/> to learn
more.
        </p>
        <p>
When you're happy with your updated README, click the
<q>Commit changes</q> button. This will create a new
<term>commit</term>, representing a new moment in your
project's history. You should write a useful commit message
summarizing the work you've done since your last commit
(or perhaps keep the default <q>Update README.md</q>)
Doing this will update the README visible on your repository
homepage on GitHub.com.
