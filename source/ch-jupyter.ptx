      <url href="https://python.org">Python</url> is an
      popular open-source all-purpose programming language, and
      a convenient way to write, execute, and share the
      results of Python code is a
      <url href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</url>.
          </p>
          <p>
      To get started, create a Codespace
      (<xref ref="note-create-codespace"/>)
      on either an existing or new repository
      (<xref ref="sec-creating-the-repo"/>).
      You can then create a Jupyter notebook file named
      <c>notebook.ipynb</c>.
          </p>
          <note xml:id="note-provision-notebook">
            <p>
      In a Codespace, any file with the extension <c>*.ipynb</c>
      (short for <q><em>IPY</em>thon <em>N</em>ote<em>B</em>ook</q>,
      Jupyter's original name)
      will be treated as a
      Jupyter notebook. When opening this file, you'll see a notebook
      interface, and be prompted to
      <q>install the recommended 'Python' extension</q> if it's
      not already enabled - do this.
            </p>
            <p>
      Then in your notebook file, click the <q>Select Kernel</q>
      button, then <q>Install/Enable suggested extensions</q> for
      Python+Jupyter. You should then have the option to select
      a <q>Python environment</q> such as <c>Python 3.*.*</c>.
            </p>
            <p>
      If successful, you should be able to enter
      <c>import sys; print(sys.version)</c> into the displayed
      text box,
      and see the result of executing it with
      <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.
            </p>
          </note>
          <p>
      There are plenty of existing tutorials on the internet to help you
      get acquainted with Python and Jupyter now that you have them
      available to you in your Codespace. But to get you started, I've provided
      one <dataurl source="sample-notebook.ipynb">sample notebook</dataurl>
      that you can upload to your Codespace to break the ice.
