    <introduction>
        <p>
The goal of this chapter is to get you started seeing how
mathematicans use GitHub in various ways by way of three
specific examples.

        <title>PreTeXt</title>
        <p>
<url href="https://pretextbook.org/">PreTeXt</url>
is an authoring and publishing system for 
scholarly documents, especially in STEM disciplines.
Worked authored in PreTeXt can be converted to HTML,
PDF, braille, and many other formats. This book was
written in PreTeXt!
        </p>
        <p>
PreTeXt is particularly well-suited for the creation of
interactive and accessible Open Educational Resources in
mathematics and computer science. Works authored in PreTeXt
can be deployed to
<url href="https://runestone.academy">Runestone Academy</url>,
allowing students to log into their textbook and persist progress
on exercises and activities.
        </p>
        <p>
The
<url href="https://prose.runestone.academy">PROSE Consortium</url>
forms the broader ecosystem serving open-source STEM open educational
resources and offers regular drop-in meetings for community members
to learn more about its products, which also include
<url href="https://openwebwork.org/">WeBWorK</url> and
<url href="https://www.doenet.org/">Doenet</url>.

<url href="https://stevenclontz.github.io/pretext-getting-started-2023">
    Getting Started with PreTeXt
</url> is a tutorial that uses GitHub Codespaces to get authors
up and writing quickly, and helps them share their works on
GitHub and GitHub Pages.

        <title>Lean theorem prover</title>
        <p>
The <url href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/">Lean theorem prover</url>
is an interactive proof assistant that allows mathematicians to formally
verify their proofs by computer.

The textbook
<url href="https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathematics_in_lean?tab=readme-ov-file#to-use-this-repository-with-github-codespaces">
    Mathematics in Lean
</url>
provides an excellent introduction to authoring in Lean, with GitHub
Codespaces support. (For a more casual experience outside GitHub, the
<url href="https://adam.math.hhu.de/">Lean game server</url> has fun
tutorials for both Peano axioms and naive set theory.)
