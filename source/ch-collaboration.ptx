A nice feature of collaborative authoring tools such
as Google Docs and Overleaf is the ability for several
collaborators to edit the same file synchronously. This
works similarly to <c>GitHub.dev</c>.

A particular downside of LiveShare (<xref ref="sec-liveshare"/>)
is that it requires
the repository owner to create the Codespace and provision
the LiveShare session. As a result, there's no way for a
collaborator to make a contribution via LiveShare to a GitHub project
without the active involvement of the repository owner.
    </p>
    <p>
To address this, one solution is for the repository owner to
add other GitHub users as collaborators.

A <term>collaborator</term> for a GitHub repository has the ability
to commit and sync changes to the project, as well as adjust certain settings
of the repository.

  GitHub documentation
</url>
provides some details on the different permissions/abilities that owners
have in comparison to collaborators.
        </p>
      </statement>

    <p>
Collaborators are added by going to your repository's Settings tab,
using the Collaborators link in the sidebar. Each collaborator will
need their own GitHub account, and must accept the invitation to
collaborate before gaining access.
    </p>
    <p>
Once they have access, a collaborator can create a Codespace
(<xref ref="def-codespaces"/>)
