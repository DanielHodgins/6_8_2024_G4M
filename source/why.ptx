    <title>Why do I need to <q>get</q> Git?</title>
    <p>
Increasingly, the work of mathematicians relies upon digital products
such as software, datasets, documentation, and infrastructure. While
most mathematicians don't need the skillset of a full-fledged software
engineer, many of us can benefit from certain conveniences that
software engineers take for granted.

One such nicety is version control, software that provides support
for tracking ongoing progress of a multi-file project contributed to
by any number of people, and Git is the industry standard.
For many years, Git required comfort with a command line interface
(e.g. typing <c>git commit -m "very important message"</c> into a
terminal). But recent developments have made this functionality
available in a graphical user interface to anyone with a steady internet
connection and an updated web browser, just by making an account
at <url href="https://github.com">GitHub.com</url>.

In <xref ref="ch-git-github"/>, <xref ref="ch-first-repo"/>, and
<xref ref="ch-website"/> you'll learn the basics of using GitHub to
create simple projects, including a website portfolio. Then
<xref ref="ch-pi-base"/>, <xref ref="ch-coding"/>, <xref ref="ch-oer"/>,
and <xref ref="ch-lean"/> will introduce how mathematicians are using
this infrastructure to develop databases, compute results, write
textbooks, and formally prove theorems. Finally in
<xref ref="ch-collaboration"/> you'll learn how to collaborate with
colleagues and engage in the broader open-source community on GitHub.

I hope you enjoy learning how these tools can be used to advance
your mathematical goals. And if you want to connect with a broader community
of scholars in this space, I highly encourage you to connect with us
at either <url href="https://code4math.org">code4math.org</url> (for
research mathematics) or
<url href="https://prose.runestone.academy">prose.runestone.academy</url>
(for STEM education).
