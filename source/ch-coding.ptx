    <p>
While the quick <c>GitHub.dev</c> interface is great
for quick edits, many projects require the ability
to run applications and execute code as you would on
your personal computer. Fortunately, GitHub offers a
service to run such programs on their servers.

      <statement>
        <p>
A <term>Codespace</term> is a <q>dev environment</q> service
<url href="https://github.com/features/codespaces">offered by GitHub</url>.
Each codespace is essentially a personal virtual computer that
runs in the cloud, that you access through your web browser.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    <note>
      <p>
To create a Codespace on any repository you own, use the green
<q>Code</q> button, select the Codespaces tab, and press
the green <q>Create codespace on [branchname]</q> button.
      </p>
    </note>
    <p>
After the Codespace boots up, you'll have an interface similar
to the <c>GitHub.dev</c> environment you learned about in
<xref ref="sec-using-github-dev"/>.

Here are a few key differences between
GitHub.dev and Codespaces.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
A GitHub.dev URL looks like <c>github.dev/username/reponame</c>,
while a Codespace URL looks like
<c>random-word-123randomcharacters789.github.dev</c>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
GitHub.dev is quicker to load than a Codespace.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
GitHub.dev has a much more limited selection of VS Code
extensions to use.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
You can only install applications and execute code on a Codespace.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>

GitHub users are provided with a limited amount of free Codespace
hours and storage each month, with additional resources available
to Pro users, including those with the free GitHub Education
benefit (<xref ref="github-education-discount"/>). If needed,
there is the option to pay for additional resources.
    </p>
    <p>
As a mathematician
who almost exclusively uses GitHub Codespaces for doing their work,
I've found that I often approach the quota for Pro users, but have
not yet exceeded it. I accomplish this by being sure to not run
my Codespaces when I'm not actively working on them.
    </p>
    <note xml:id="note-manage-codespaces">
      <p>
To manage your Codespace resources, visit
<url href="https://github.com/codespaces"/>.
You can stop a Codespace temporarily to preserve your hourly quota,
and delete a Codespace you don't plan to use for a while to save
on your storage quota. While actively working in a Codespace,
you can stop it by pressing
<kbd>Ctrl/Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>,
typing <c>stop current codespace</c>, and confirming.
      </p>
      <p>
In any case, a
stopped Codespace can be restarted later when you want to
resume work, even if you haven't committed and pushed your changes.
A deleted Codespace can be recreated later based upon your most recent
commit.
